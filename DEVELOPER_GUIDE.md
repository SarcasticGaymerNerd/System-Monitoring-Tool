## Introduction
The System Monitoring Tool is a web application designed to monitor system health metrics, manage alerts, and perform maintenance tasks. This guide provides developers with an overview of the codebase, setup instructions, and guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Code Structure
The project is organized into two main directories: `frontend` and `backend`.

- **frontend/**: Contains the React.js or Vue.js application.
  - `src/`: Source code for the frontend application.
  - `public/`: Static files and assets.
  - `package.json`: Dependencies and scripts for the frontend.

- **backend/**: Contains the Flask (Python) or Express (Node.js) application.
  - `app.py` or `app.js`: Main application file.
  - `models.py`: Database models.
  - `routes.py`: API endpoint definitions.
  - `requirements.txt` or `package.json`: Dependencies for the backend.

## Setup
To set up the development environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/system-monitoring-tool.git
   cd system-monitoring-tool
   ```

2. **Set Up the Frontend**:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```

3. **Set Up the Backend**:
   - Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the backend directory to store sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, API keys).

5. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     python app.py
     ```
   - Start the frontend development server:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm start
     ```

## API Documentation
The following API endpoints are available:

- **GET /api/health**: Check system health.
- **POST /api/logs**: Create a new log entry.
- **GET /api/logs**: Retrieve all log entries.
- **PUT /api/logs/:id**: Update a log entry by ID.
- **DELETE /api/logs/:id**: Delete a log entry by ID.
- **GET /api/resources**: Retrieve system resource metrics.
- **POST /api/maintenance**: Execute maintenance tasks.

Refer to the code in `routes.py` for detailed implementation.

## Testing
To run tests for the application, follow these steps:

- **For Python (using pytest)**:
  ```bash
  cd backend
  pytest
  ```

- **For Node.js (using Jest)**:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm test
  ```

Ensure that all tests pass before submitting changes.

## Deployment
To deploy the application, follow the deployment instructions in the [Deployment section](Step-by-Step%20Development%20Guide.md#deployment) of the main development guide. You can deploy to services like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
