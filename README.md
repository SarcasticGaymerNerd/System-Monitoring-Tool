# System Monitoring Tool

## Overview
The System Monitoring Tool is a web application designed to monitor system health metrics, manage alerts, and perform maintenance tasks. It provides a user-friendly dashboard for visualizing system performance and integrates with various notification services to keep users informed of critical events.

## Features
- **Dashboard**: Displays real-time system health metrics.
- **Alerts**: Sends notifications for system issues via Twilio, SendGrid, or Slack.
- **Maintenance Tasks**: Interfaces for executing tasks like disk cleanup and service restarts.
- **API Endpoints**: Provides endpoints for system status, logs, maintenance tasks, and notifications.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Periodically checks system metrics and updates the database.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js or Vue.js
- **Backend**: Flask (Python) or Express (Node.js)
- **Database**: SQLite or PostgreSQL
- **Testing**: pytest (Python) or Jest (Node.js)
- **Deployment**: Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm (for frontend)
- Python and pip (for backend)
- PostgreSQL or SQLite (for database)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SarcasticGaymerNerd/System-Monitoring-Tool.git
   cd system-monitoring-tool
   ```

2. Set up the frontend:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```

3. Set up the backend:
   - Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. Configure the database and environment variables as needed.

### Running the Application
- Start the backend server:
  ```bash
  cd backend
  python app.py
  ```

- Start the frontend development server:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm start
  ```

- Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
- Use the dashboard to monitor system health metrics.
- Set up alerts for critical system events.
- Execute maintenance tasks directly from the interface.

## Testing
- To run unit tests for the backend:
  ```bash
  cd backend
  pytest
  ```

- To run unit tests for the frontend:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm test
  ```
